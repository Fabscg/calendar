# Calendar

## It is a Work-Day-Scheduler
## As a developer I need to be able to plan my day andbe able to have it in my calendar to see my meeting ,classes, homework and another things realted to school.

*I had created this page with the specific hours that I usually use to stydy and do homework*

At the top of the page we have the title and under the title I display the day of the week, month, day and year that updates in regular basis to make sure i am not missing any class

## Also I have the ability to write the task or plan od the day ahead of me and save it in the calendar by clicking in the save button 

## As it is save the calendar also has a dynamic colors to make sure ityou dont missed anything
